**** Corrected Z tracking mistake
     :LOGBOOK:
     - Added [2017-11-15 Wed 12:44]
     - Based on toushik said i corrected the mistake of tracking the 
       muons from the z bosons.
        and also only the hardest jet is considered now.

**** Wrote code for JetImages
     :LOGBOOK:
     - Added [2017-12-12 Tue 00:37]
     - JetImages are drawn and updated. Next Goal is to rewrite the 
       code of the histograms in MatPlotLib
       And also to use neural networks to discriminate based on JetImages
