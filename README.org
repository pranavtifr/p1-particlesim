* Pythia Settings
 The processes chosen were 


 \[q \bar{q} \rightarrow Z + g \]
and,

\[q + g \rightarrow Z + q\]

More details on the settings can be seen at [[./process-generation-code/settings-qgZ.cmnd]]
Number of Events = 10000
* FastJet Settings
These plots were produced after the events are generated in pythia and then
clustered into jets using anti-kt algorithm using E-Scheme
** Grooming
   The jets were groomed using Soft-Drop algorithm

** E_2
  This was the formula used for the Calculating e2
  

 \[e_2 = \Sigma_{j \in jet} z_i \theta_i^2\]
Where,

\[z_i \equiv \frac{p_{Ti}}{\Sigma_{j \in jet} p_{Tj} }\quad \theta_i =\frac{ R_{i \hat{n}}}{R}\]

Reference for the formula of e_2 [[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.03878.pdf]]
* Plots
 For all the plots the histogram of e_2 was plotted in a logarithmic scale
